      "prompt": "Start with the input image. Keep the background and lighting exactly the same. Animate the character performing a meme-style dance based on Donald Trump’s iconic rally moves: alternate between lifting the right and left arms forward in a light pumping motion, with fists slightly clenched. Sync each arm movement with a slight bend in the same-side knee — right arm forward with right knee flexing slightly, then left arm with left knee. Keep the torso upright and movements slow, controlled, and rhythmically awkward. Facial expression remains focused or mildly amused. Avoid exaggerated dancing or fast motions.",

      "prompt": "Start with the input image and preserve the subject’s gender, facial features, and identity exactly as they appear. Begin with the subject standing in place, then animate a graceful but powerful spin around their own axis. As they rotate, swirl glowing energy ribbons, light trails, and aura effects around their body. Mid-spin, add speed lines and camera shake. When the spin ends, the subject stomps or lands with force, striking a dramatic pose. At this precise moment, simulate a transformation burst: a flash of light, clothing shifts into a stylized anime costume while keeping the character’s silhouette and personality intact. Hair may flow more dramatically, and colors may intensify, but identity must remain the same. The background pulses with energy and distortions. Add anime visual effects — sparkles, speed lines, glowing highlights — all synchronized with camera motion circling the subject. End with a freeze-frame of the same person, now in anime form, in a confident or powerful final pose, surrounded by visual energy.",

Only minimal slow-motion movement is allowed: a slight head turn or left-hand sunglasses adjustment. Avoid all exaggerated, dance-like, or playful movements. The character must appear serious and grounded. Add red and blue police light reflections, slight background heat shimmer, and a gentle handheld camera zoom-in to complete the scene.",

As the heart completes, the subject tilts their head slightly, holds eye contact with the camera, and blows a kiss forward with a confident, flirty expression. A glowing pink heart floats out from the lips, leaving behind sparkles and light trails as it moves toward the viewer. Add a soft ambient glow, subtle bokeh in the background, and light particles drifting through the air. The subject remains mostly still, except for graceful hand and head motion. The entire scene should feel elegant, romantic, and slightly cheeky — perfect for social media.",

The hands and arms must be active: one character places a hand firmly on the other’s jawline or neck, the second character may wrap an arm around the waist or pull them in closer. Facial muscles should slightly flex to reflect tension and passion. Keep eye expressions softly closed. Lighting should be warm and dim, with soft shadows and a tight cinematic frame.
